# Project 1: Gene Expression Prediction using Genetic Markers

## 1. Background and Introduction

As explained in the class, the primary goal of this project is to build machine learning algorithms for predicting gene expression levels using genotype data. This is an active research area in genetics and genomics, the following papers provide necessary background on this topic.
